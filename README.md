![Terminal Screenshot](terminal.png)

This is a repository for my MacOS terminal setup. I primarily made this setup based on other guides that were uploaded on YouTube. However, I didn't need everything that a lot of these guides recommended to use so I only installed what I personally needed.

> With that being said, this doesn't necessarily mean that this setup won't change in the future! :)

# Prerequisites

My preferred choice of terminal for MacOS is iTerm2. I enjoy this terminal purely for the customization. I find that it's alot easier to customize to my liking over the default terminal. 

You can install this terminal [here](https://iterm2.com/downloads.html)

# Installation

**Homebrew**

Homebrew is probably the most #1 used package manager for MacOS. I use this whenever I have to install a package. 

You can install homebrew by pasting in the following line:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

You might be prompted to enter your password, after which it should start installing. Be sure to pay attention to the terminal as it should spit out a line for adding `brew` to your PATH directory. You'll want to copy and paste that line and enter it into your terminal to finish the job!
