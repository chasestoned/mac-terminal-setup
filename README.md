# mac-terminal-setup
![Terminal Screenshot](terminal.png)

This is a repository for my MacOS terminal setup. I primarily made this setup based on other guides that were uploaded on YouTube. However, I didn't need everything that a lot of these guides recommended to use so I only installed what I personally needed.

> With that being said, this doesn't necessarily mean that this setup won't change in the future! :)
